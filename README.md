P-moon-s-distributed-filesystem
===============================

A scalable distributed file system using Java and RMI to allow transparent file access across multiple machines.

This was built as part of a distributed systems course I took in third year in University. I implemented a
security service using a full kerberos network authentication service, a directory service, a locking service, 
a caching service as well as offering transparent file access.
